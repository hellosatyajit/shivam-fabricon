            Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and millions already have.
            Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by presenting information on all branches of knowledge. Hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikipedia consists of freely editable content, with articles that often contain numerous links guiding readers to more information.
            Written collaboratively by volunteers known as Wikipedians, Wikipedia articles can be edited by anyone with Internet access, except in limited cases in which editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism. Since its creation on January 15, 2001, it has grown into the world's largest reference website, attracting over a billion visitors each month. Wikipedia currently has more than sixty-four million articles in more than 300 languages, including 6,930,526 articles in English, with 119,004 active contributors in the past month.

              Anyone can edit Wikipedia's text, references, and images. The quality of content is more important than who contributes it. The content must conform with Wikipedia's policies, including being verifiable by published reliable sources. Contributions based on personal opinions, beliefs, personal experiences, unreviewed research, libellous material, and copyright violations are not allowed and will not remain. Wikipedia's software allows easy reversal of errors, and experienced editors watch and patrol bad edits.
